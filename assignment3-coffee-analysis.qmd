## Executive Summary

## Introduction

According to @scanderBeverageConsumptionPatterns2018, coffee is the second highest consumed beverage in volume, after water, in the world. No wonder it plays a central role in daily routines of workers all over the world, influencing both productivity and spending habits. According to @smithCaffeineWork2005, caffeine consumption enhances alertness, shortens reaction time, and improves mental clarity in the workspace. The working model shift to remote and hybrid work become increasingly common and so does the coffee consumption patterns by the working people. In a survey dataset published by James Hoffman, a pioneer of third wave coffee movement and a World Champion Barista, along with a coffee company Cometeer held a survey of around 4000 individuals about four coffees and where coffee drinkers were asked about their demographics, coffee drinking habits, coffee taste preferences, and their spending habits, which according to @StateHybridWork could be approximately 25% of total spending in a working day! Through this survey data, this report explores how working location influences daily coffee consumption, monthly coffee spends, and consumer's willingness to splurge on premium brews. By comparing different behaviours we can provide insights into shift in consumer habits in the coffee industry.
