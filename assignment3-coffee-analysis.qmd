## Executive Summary

## Introduction

According to @scanderBeverageConsumptionPatterns2018, coffee is the second highest consumed beverage in volume, after water, in the world. No wonder it plays a central role in daily routines of workers all over the world, influencing both productivity and spending habits. According to @smithCaffeineWork2005, caffeine consumption enhances alertness, shortens reaction time, and improves mental clarity in the workspace. The working model shift to remote and hybrid work become increasingly common and so does the coffee consumption patterns by the working people. In a survey dataset published by James Hoffman, a pioneer of third wave coffee movement and a World Champion Barista, along with a coffee company Cometeer held a survey of around 4000 individuals about four coffees and where coffee drinkers were asked about their demographics, coffee drinking habits, coffee taste preferences, and their spending habits, which according to @StateHybridWork could be approximately 25% of total spending in a working day! Through this survey data, this report explores how working location influences daily coffee consumption, monthly coffee spends, and consumer's willingness to splurge on premium brews. By comparing different behaviours we can provide insights into shift in consumer habits in the coffee industry.

## Methodology

The survey categorizes respondents into three groups: those who work from home, those who work in an office, and those with a hybrid work arrangement. Using a questionnaire format, the survey focuses on participants’ coffee consumption habits. 

```{r}
#| label: library-packages

library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
#| label: read-file

coffee_survey <- read_csv(here::here("data/coffee_survey.csv"))

coffee_survey_selected <- coffee_survey %>%
  select("submission_id", "wfh", "cups", "total_spend", "most_paid") %>%
  mutate(wfh = recode(wfh, "I do a mix of both" = "both", 
                      "I primarily work from home" = "remote", 
                      "I primarily work in person" = "in_person"))

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-coffee
#| tbl-cap: "Proportion of Participants by Work Mode"

work_mode_summary <- coffee_survey_selected %>%
  filter(!is.na(wfh)) %>%
  count(wfh) %>%
  mutate(work_mode = wfh, 
         proportion = scales::percent(n/sum(n))) %>%
  select(work_mode, n, proportion)
  
knitr::kable(work_mode_summary)

```

 @tbl-coffee is used to show the number of people in each group, and calculate the percentage of them within the total sample. So that we can compare the proportion of different groups. 

```{r}
#| label: draw-bar-charts

cup_sum <- coffee_survey_selected %>%
  filter(!is.na(cups), !is.na(wfh)) %>%
  count(cups, wfh) %>%
  mutate(cups = factor(
    cups, 
    levels = c("Less than 1", "1", "2", "3", "4", "More than 4"))
    )

p1 <- cup_sum %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cups, y = n, fill = wfh)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge", width = 0.6) + 
  labs(
    title = "Cups of coffee per day", 
    x = "Cups", 
    y = "Number of people", 
    fill = "Work Mode") + 
  theme_minimal()

total_spend_sum <- coffee_survey_selected %>%
  filter(!is.na(total_spend), !is.na(wfh)) %>%
  count(total_spend, wfh) %>%
  mutate(total_spend = factor(
    total_spend, levels = c(
      "<$20", "$20-$40", "$40-$60", "$60-$80", "$80-$100", ">$100"))
    )

p2 <- total_spend_sum %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_spend, y = n, fill = wfh)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge", width = 0.6) + 
  labs(
    title = "Money spent on coffee per month", 
    x = "Spending Range", y = "Number of People", fill = "Work Mode"
    ) + 
  theme_minimal()

most_paid_sum <- coffee_survey_selected %>%
  filter(!is.na(most_paid), !is.na(wfh)) %>%
  count(most_paid, wfh) %>%
  mutate(most_paid = factor(most_paid, levels = c(
    "Less than $2", "$2-$4", "$4-$6", "$6-$8", "$8-$10", 
    "$10-$15", "$15-$20", "More than $20"))
    )

p3 <- most_paid_sum %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = most_paid, y = n, fill = wfh)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge", width = 0.6) + 
  labs(title = "Maximum Price Paid for a Cup of Coffee", 
       x = "Spending Range", y = "Number of People", fill = "Work Mode"
       ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r, out.width="80%"}
#| label: fig-coffee
#| fig-cap: "Research results"

p1 <- p1 + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
p2 <- p2 + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
p3 <- p3 + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

combined <- (p1 | p2) / (p3 | patchwork::plot_spacer()) 

ggsave("combined_plot.png", combined, width = 14, height = 10)

knitr::include_graphics("combined_plot.png")

```

According to @fig-coffee , we can make comparisons across the three groups, showing their daily coffee consumption, monthly coffee spending, and the maximum price paid for a cup of coffee. This allows us to observe respondents’ preferences and behavior regarding coffee consumption. Building on these insights, we can further apply cluster analysis to categorize consumers into different types, which helps us draw more conclusions.
