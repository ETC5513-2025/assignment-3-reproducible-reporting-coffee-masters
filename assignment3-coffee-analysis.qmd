## Executive Summary

- This analysis of 4,000 coffee consumers reveals that remote workers consume more coffee and spend more monthly compared to office workers, despite similar price preferences for individual cups.
- Both groups predominantly drink two cups daily and spend \$20-50 monthly, with most paying \$6-15 per cup, but remote workers show higher proportions in consumption and spending categories.
- The findings suggest remote workers have developed a stronger reliance on coffee, representing a significant market segment with both high intake and spending behaviors.
- To address potential health risks and better understand consumption drivers, the study recommends promoting healthier consumption awareness and expanding research with additional variables and qualitative analysis.
