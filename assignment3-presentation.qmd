## Introduction

- Coffee = 2nd most consumed beverage globally after water (Scander et al., 2018)

- Boosts productivity: alertness, clarity, and reaction time (Smith, 2005)

- Shift to remote & hybrid work is transforming coffee routines

- Up to 25% of a workerâ€™s daily spending may go to coffee (State of Hybrid Work, 2025)

## Dataset Description

```{r}
#| label: read-coffee-dataset
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| error: false

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

coffee <- read_csv(here::here("data/coffee_survey.csv"))
```


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width = "60%"}

- Created by James Hoffmann (World Champion Barista) & Cometeer

- `r nrow(coffee)` participants: U.S. coffee drinkers

- Surveyed on `r ncol(coffee)` variables:

  - Demographics & work location

  - Daily intake & brew methods

  - Taste preferences

  - Spending habits

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods

**Respondents are grouped(`wfh`) into:**

-   Work from home(`remote`)

-   Work in office(`in_person`)

-   Hybrid work(`both`)

**Our analysis focused on:**

-   Daily coffee consumption(`cups`)

-   Monthly coffee spending(`total_spend`)

-   Highest price paid for one cup(`most_paid`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods

- **Grouping & Analysis**  
  Make bar charts to show the number and proportion of participants in each work group.

  Compare groups by daily consumption, monthly spending, highest paid price. 

- **Further Analysis**  
  Based on the observed behavior, cluster analysis is proposed to classify consumers into distinct preference types, offering deeper insights.

- Different work modes have similar preferences  
  for coffee price  
- People who drink two cups of coffee a day  
  account for the highest proportion in all groups  
- The average coffee consumption of remote  
  working groups tends to be the highest

Work from Home Group 

- **High Consumption and High Intake** 
- Low Consumption  
- Conflicting Groups

## Conclusions

-   Conclusion
    -   Remote working group has relatively high consumption.
    -   Cluster Analysis: High Coffee Intake & High Speeding
-   Recommendation
    -   Health Awareness & Alternative Promotion
    -   Further Date-Driven Consumption Analysis
