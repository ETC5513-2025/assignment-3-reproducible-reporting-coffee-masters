## Introduction

::: {.incremental}

- Coffee = 2nd most consumed beverage globally after water (Scander et al., 2018)

- Boosts productivity: alertness, clarity, and reaction time (Smith, 2005)

- Shift to remote & hybrid work is transforming coffee routines

- Up to 25% of a worker’s daily spending may go to coffee (State of Hybrid Work, 2025)

**Our Question**: - *How does work location (remote vs. in-person) affect daily coffee consumption, total monthly spend, and what is the most you’ve ever paid for?*

- Created by *James Hoffmann* (World Champion Barista) & *Cometeer*

- `r nrow(coffee)` participants: U.S. coffee drinkers

- Surveyed on `r ncol(coffee)` variables:

  - Demographics & work location

  - Daily intake & brew methods

  - Taste preferences

  - Spending habits

coffee |> 
  select("wfh", "cups", "total_spend", "most_paid") |>
  rename(
    `Work Location Type` = wfh,
    `Number of cups per day` = cups,
    `Total Monthly Spend` = total_spend,
    `Most paid for a cup` = most_paid
  ) |>
  mutate(`Work Location Type` = recode(`Work Location Type`, "I do a mix of both" = "Hybrid", 
                      "I primarily work from home" = "Remote", 
                      "I primarily work in person" = "In Person")) |>
  filter(!is.na(`Work Location Type`)) |>
  head(10) |> 
  kable()
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods

**Respondents are grouped(`wfh`) into:**

-   Work from home(`Remote`)

-   Work in office(`In Person`)

-   Hybrid work(`Hybrid`)

**Our analysis focused on:**

-   Daily coffee consumption(`cups`)

-   Monthly coffee spending(`total_spend`)

-   Highest price paid for one cup(`most_paid`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods

- **Grouping & Analysis**  
  Make a table to show the number and proportion of participants in each work group.

  Compare groups by daily consumption, monthly spending, highest paid price. 

- **Further Analysis**  
  Based on the observed behaviour, cluster analysis is proposed to classify consumers into distinct preference types, offering deeper insights.

- Different work modes have similar preferences for coffee price
- People who drink two cups of coffee a day account for the highest proportion in all groups  
- The average coffee consumption of remote working groups tends to be the highest

**Work from Home Group**

- *High Consumption and High Intake*
- *Low Consumption*  
- *Conflicting Groups*

## Conclusions

-   **Conclusion**
    -   Remote working group has relatively high consumption.
    -   Cluster Analysis: High Coffee Intake & High Speeding
-   **Recommendation**
    -   Health Awareness & Alternative Promotion
    -   Further Date-Driven Consumption Analysis
